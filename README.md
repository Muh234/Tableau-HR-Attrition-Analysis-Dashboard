## Understanding the Problem

Employee attrition — the rate at which employees leave an organization — is a growing concern for many companies. High turnover leads to increased hiring costs, reduced team morale, and loss of institutional knowledge.

Factors like work-life balance, job satisfaction, overtime, and income disparity play critical roles in influencing employee decisions to stay or leave. Yet, many HR departments struggle to interpret these factors effectively due to scattered data and lack of visualization.

This project addresses that gap by presenting a clear, interactive view of attrition trends and helping decision-makers uncover why employees are leaving and what can be done about it.



## Project Goal

To create a clean, insightful, and interactive Tableau dashboard that simplifies the analysis of employee attrition data.

The goal is to enable HR professionals and decision-makers to:
- Identify key factors driving attrition.  
- Visualize department- and demographic-level patterns.  
- Develop data-driven strategies to improve employee retention.



## What I Did

### Data Familiarization
- Explored the HR attrition dataset, containing attributes such as age, gender, department, income, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and overtime.
- Understood relationships between variables using exploratory data analysis (EDA) within Tableau.

### Data Cleaning
- Verified and removed duplicate entries.  
- Standardized categorical data (e.g., gender, department names).  
- Ensured numeric data (income, years at company) were correctly formatted.  
- Checked consistency in attrition labels (Yes/No).

### Data Modeling & Analysis
- Created calculated fields to measure attrition rates by department and gender.  
- Designed KPIs showing average monthly income, satisfaction levels, and work-life balance.  
- Built filters and parameters for dynamic exploration across departments, gender, and years of service.

### Dashboard Creation
- Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard that features:
  - Visual cards highlighting overall attrition rate, average income, and employee satisfaction.
  - Charts showing attrition by department, job satisfaction, and work-life balance.
  - Filters for gender, department, and overtime to allow detailed exploration.
  - A consistent color theme and layout designed for clarity and stakeholder appeal.



## Dashboard Overview

The final Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive, interactive view of employee attrition trends.
It allows users to explore how satisfaction levels, overtime frequency, and income vary across departments — revealing hidden patterns that can influence retention strategies.

The dashboard serves as a practical business intelligence tool that demonstrates the power of Tableau for HR analytics.



## Key Insights

- Employees with low job satisfaction and poor work-life balance are the most likely to leave.  
- Overtime significantly increases attrition rates, especially among younger employees.  
- Mid-level employees (3–7 years of experience) show the highest attrition levels, often due to limited growth opportunities.  
- Departments with lower income averages experience greater turnover, pointing to pay-related dissatisfaction.  
- A better training frequency correlates with improved retention.
