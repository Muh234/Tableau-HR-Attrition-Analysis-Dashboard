##  Understanding the Problem

Employee attrition — the rate at which employees leave an organization — is a growing concern for many companies.  
High turnover leads to **increased hiring costs**, **reduced team morale**, and **loss of institutional knowledge**.

Factors like **work-life balance, job satisfaction, overtime, and income disparity** play critical roles in influencing employee decisions to stay or leave.  
Yet, many HR departments struggle to interpret these factors effectively due to **scattered data** and **lack of visualization**.

This project addresses that gap by presenting a clear, interactive view of attrition trends and helping decision-makers uncover **why employees are leaving** and **what can be done about it**.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To create a clean, insightful, and interactive **Tableau dashboard** that simplifies the analysis of employee attrition data.

The goal is to enable HR professionals and decision-makers to:
- Identify key factors driving attrition  
- Visualize department- and demographic-level patterns  
- Develop **data-driven strategies** to improve employee retention

## ⚙️ What I Did

###  Data Familiarization
- Explored the HR attrition dataset containing attributes such as **age, gender, department, income, job satisfaction, work-life balance,** and **overtime**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) within Tableau to understand relationships and correlations between variables

###  Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate entries  
- Standardized categorical data (e.g., gender, department names)  
- Ensured numeric data (income, years at company) were correctly formatted  
- Verified consistency in attrition labels (“Yes/No”)  

###  Data Modeling & Analysis
- Created **calculated fields** to measure attrition rates by department and gender  
- Designed **KPIs** showing average monthly income, satisfaction levels, and work-life balance  
- Built **filters and parameters** for dynamic exploration across departments, gender, and years of service  

###  Dashboard Creation
Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard featuring:
- Visual cards showing overall attrition rate, average income, and satisfaction scores  
- Charts for attrition by department, job satisfaction, and work-life balance  
- Filters for gender, department, and overtime to allow detailed exploration  
- A clean and consistent color palette designed for **clarity and visual appeal**  



##  Dashboard Overview

The final Tableau dashboard provides a **comprehensive, interactive view** of employee attrition trends.  
It allows users to explore how satisfaction levels, overtime frequency, and income vary across departments — revealing hidden patterns that can influence retention strategies.

The dashboard serves as a **business intelligence tool** that demonstrates the power of Tableau for HR analytics.

##  Key Insights

- Employees with **low job satisfaction** and **poor work-life balance** are most likely to leave  
- **Overtime** significantly increases attrition, especially among younger employees  
- **Mid-level employees** (3–7 years) show the highest attrition, often due to limited growth opportunities  
- Departments with **lower income averages** experience greater turnover  
- **Frequent training and development** correlate with improved retention
